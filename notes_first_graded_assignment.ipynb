    "##### For Age Between 18 - 30 , Find the Top 5 Athlete by Number of Gold Medals Won.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the top 5 athletes aged between 18 and 30 who have won the most gold medals, you can filter the DataFrame based on the age range and the medal type. Here’s how you can do it:\n",
    "Python Solution\n",
    "Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "1. Filtering the DataFrame:\n",
    "The line gold_medalists_age_range = df[(df['Age'].between(18, 30)) & (df['Medal'] == 'Gold')] filters the DataFrame to include only athletes whose age is between 18 and 30 and who have won gold medals.\n",
    "2. Counting Gold Medals:\n",
    "The line top_gold_athlete_counts = gold_medalists_age_range['Name'].value_counts().head(5) counts the number of gold medals for each athlete in the filtered DataFrame and selects the top 5 athletes based on the number of gold medals won.\n",
    "Displaying Results:\n",
    "The print statement outputs the top 5 athletes aged between 18 and 30 who have won the most gold medals.\n",
    "This analysis will help you identify the most successful young athletes in terms of gold medal achievements.\n",
    "Merging Data from Two Tables\n",

    "Oftenly it occurs, we have two CSVs one with the All the Data and the Other with Reference Data to Lookup, In our data we have Athletes with Short Country name, can you Show Country Names by Merging both CSVs and showing Country Names in Full instead of Acronyms\n",

    "Use: NOC_Regions.csv , Load it in Another data frame and Complete the task\n",

    "##### Question : Which Country has the tallest athletes in Latest Olympics? Display Top 5 (Country Names)\n",
    "\n",
    "To merge the main dataset with the NOC_Regions.csv file and display the full country names instead of acronyms, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Load both datasets.\n",
    "2. Merge the datasets on the appropriate key (usually the country code).\n",
    "3. Analyze the merged dataset to find the tallest athletes and display the top 5 countries.\n",
    "Python Solution\n",
    "Assuming you have the main dataset loaded in a DataFrame called df and the NOC_Regions.csv file contains the mapping of country codes to full country names, here’s how you can do it:\n",
    "Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "Loading the Datasets:\n",
    "The main dataset (athlete_events.csv) and the NOC Regions dataset (NOC_Regions.csv) are loaded into separate DataFrames.\n",
    "2. Merging the Datasets:\n",
    "The pd.merge() function is used to merge the two DataFrames on the 'NOC' column, which is assumed to be the common key. The how='left' parameter ensures that all records from the main dataset are retained.\n",
    "3. Finding the Tallest Athletes:\n",
    "The line tallest_athletes = merged_df[merged_df['Year'] == 2016].nlargest(5, 'Height') filters the merged DataFrame for athletes from the year 2016 and selects the top 5 tallest athletes based on the 'Height' column.\n",
    "Displaying Results:\n",
    "The final print statement outputs the top 5 countries along with the heights of the tallest athletes.\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "Ensure that the column names in the NOC_Regions.csv file match those used in the merge operation. You may need to adjust the column names based on the actual structure of your CSV files.\n",
    "If the NOC_Regions.csv file contains additional columns (like country names), you can include those in the final output as needed."
